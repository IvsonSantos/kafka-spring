Since Kafka is a distributed system, it acts as a cluster.
A Kafka cluster consists of a set of brokers.
A cluster has a minimum of 3 brokers.

The broker is the Kafka server. It's just a meaningful name given to the Kafka server.
The producer and consumer don't interact directly. They use the Kafka server as an agent or a broker to exchange messages.
PRODUCER --> KAFKA BROKER --> CONSUMER

Producer is an application that sends messages.

Consumer is an application that reads messages from the Kafka server.

Topic is like a table in a database or folder in a file system.
Topic is identified by a name.
You can have any number of topics.
